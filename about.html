                    <h3>New York City Taxi Trip Duration</h3>

                    <p>
                        The New York City Taxi Duration Prediction project aims
                        to predict the duration of taxi trips in the city. <br>
                        Leveraging historical taxi trip data, including drop-off location,
                        timestamps, and other relavant features, machine learning models are
                        developed to forecast the duration of future taxi rides accurately. <br>
                        by understanding and predicting taxi trip durations, this project
                        contributes to improving transportation efficiency, optimizing route
                        planning, and enhancing overall user experiencefoe taxi
                        passengers and drivers in New York City.

                    <p>
                        The Sport Complex Booking System project aims to develop a comprehensive
                        database solution for managing bookings and reservations at a sport complex.
                        the system facilitates the efficient scheduling of various sports facilities,
                        such as courts, fields, or gymnasiums, allowing users to reserve slots for
                        their desired activities.

                        Machine Learning Projects contains both classification and regression tasks,
                        for both classification and regression datasets the baseline models offer simplicity
                        and ease of interpretation, the k-NN models provide a more flexible and data-driven
                        approach for both classification and regression tasks.
